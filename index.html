                    <p>
                        The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling
                        horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley
                        Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers,
                        including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian.[1] The Bible also describes an animal,
                        the re'em, which some versions translate as unicorn.[1]

                        In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long horn and cloven
                        hooves (sometimes a goat's beard). In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described
                        as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only
                        by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable
                        and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold
                        as unicorn horn.

                                Chinese Mythology
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                The qilin (Chinese: 麒麟), a creature in Chinese mythology, is sometimes called "the Chinese unicorn", and some ancient accounts
                                describe a single horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described
                                as a hybrid animal that looks less unicorn than chimera, with the body of a deer, the head
                                of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese version (kirin) more
                                closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese qilin. The
                                Quẻ Ly of Vietnamese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated "unicorn" is a symbol of wealth
                                and prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong Dynasty, about 600 CE, to
                                Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in his conquest of Tây Nguyên.
                                In November 2012 the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as
                                the Korea News Service, reported that the Kiringul had been found, which is associated with
                                a kirin ridden by King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.[43][44]
