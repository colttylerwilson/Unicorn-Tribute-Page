            The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity 
            as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its 
            forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley 
            Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural 
            history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and 
            Aelian.[1] The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some versions 
            translate as unicorn.[1]

            In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white horse-like 
            or goat-like animal with a long horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's 
            beard). In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an 
            extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could 
            be captured only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have 
            the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval 
            and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as unicorn horn.

                Chinese Mythology
            </h2>
            <p>
            The qilin (Chinese: 麒麟), a creature in Chinese mythology, is sometimes 
            called "the Chinese unicorn", and some ancient accounts describe a single 
            horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a 
            hybrid animal that looks less unicorn than chimera, with the body of a deer, 
            the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The 
            Japanese version (kirin) more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even 
            though it is based on the Chinese qilin. The Quẻ Ly of Vietnamese myth, 
            similarly sometimes mistranslated "unicorn" is a symbol of wealth and 
            prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong Dynasty, about 
            600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in 
            his conquest of Tây Nguyên. In November 2012 the History Institute of the 
            DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the Korea News Service, reported 
            that the Kiringul had been found, which is associated with a kirin ridden by 
            King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.[43][44]
